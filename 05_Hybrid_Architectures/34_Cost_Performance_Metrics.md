# Cost/Performance Metrics

## Overview

ยง The economics of observability have become increasingly important as organizations scale their Kubernetes deployments. This chapter provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the cost and performance characteristics of different observability strategies, with a particular focus on comparing New Relic with alternatives in hybrid architectures. By establishing clear metrics, methodologies, and benchmarks, organizations can make data-driven decisions about their observability investments while optimizing for both technical capability and financial efficiency.

ยง As observability platforms evolve from simple monitoring tools to sophisticated analytical engines, their cost structures and performance profiles have grown more complex. Consumption-based pricing models, high-cardinality telemetry, and multi-cloud deployments all contribute to this complexity. This chapter cuts through the confusion by providing concrete measurement methodologies, comparative benchmarks, and optimization strategies that apply specifically to Kubernetes environments where New Relic operates alongside other observability solutions.

## The Observability Economics Framework

ยง To effectively evaluate observability solutions, we must consider both direct costs and derived value across multiple dimensions:

### TB-34A: Observability Economics Framework

| Dimension | Key Metrics | Evaluation Considerations | NR-Specific Metrics |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Costs** |
| Infrastructure | CPU/memory per agent, storage utilization | Resource allocation efficiency | CPU/memory per agent, GB stored per node |
| Licensing | Per-node, per-user, data volume-based costs | Licensing model alignment with usage patterns | Cost per GB ingested, user license utilization |
| Operational | FTEs required, training time, support costs | Operational complexity and external dependencies | Self-service capacity, automation potential |
| **Technical Value** |
| Data Granularity | Retention periods, sampling rates, dimensionality | Required resolution vs. cost | Dimensional flexibility, non-sampled data retention |
| Query Performance | Query latency, complex query capability, concurrency | Analysis speed and flexibility | Query engine throughput, alerting performance |
| Coverage | Monitored entities percentage, telemetry completeness | Observability gaps and depth | Entity coverage percentage, golden signals completeness |
| **Business Value** |
