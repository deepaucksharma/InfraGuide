# Advanced Topics

This section explores cutting-edge observability techniques and specialized use cases that extend the core capabilities of New Relic and related technologies.

## Contents

1. [eBPF & Host Telemetry](./01_eBPF_Host_Telemetry.md) - Low-level system observability using eBPF
2. [SLOs & Error Budgets](./02_SLOs_Error_Budgets.md) - Implementing service level objectives and error budgets
3. [Trace Correlation & Exemplars](./03_Trace_Correlation.md) - Advanced techniques for connecting metrics, logs, and traces

## Key Concepts

The Advanced Topics section addresses specialized observability challenges:

- **Deep System Visibility**: Gaining visibility into kernel-level activities and system internals
- **SRE Practices**: Implementing reliability engineering patterns for service management
- **Correlation Techniques**: Creating connections between different telemetry signals
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyzing and improving system behavior at scale

These chapters cover techniques that build upon the foundational concepts presented earlier in the book, providing solutions for specific advanced use cases.
