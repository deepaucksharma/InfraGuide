# NRDOT+ MVP Project Status

## Completed Work

We've created the basic structure and framework for the NRDOT+ MVP project:

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created a well-organized directory structure
   - Set up documentation in `docs/`
   - Created main component directories in `src/`
   - Set up scripts, Makefiles, and Docker configurations

2. **Component Implementation**
   - Implemented the CardinalityLimiter processor with entropy-based algorithm
   - Implemented the AdaptivePriorityQueue processor with WRR scheduling
   - Implemented the EnhancedDLQ exporter with SHA-256 verification and replay
   - Added proper metrics for monitoring all components

3. **Testing Utilities**
   - Implemented the workload generator with configurable profiles
   - Created sample workload profiles for different testing scenarios

4. **Configuration Files**
   - Created OpenTelemetry Collector configuration
   - Set up Docker Compose for local development
   - Prepared Prometheus and Grafana configurations
   - Created Grafana dashboards for monitoring

## Next Steps

The following tasks need to be completed to finish the MVP implementation:

1. **Testing Utilities (Completion)**
   - Implement the mock upstream service
   - Implement the outage simulator

2. **Integration**
   - Complete end-to-end testing of the three components
   - Enhance error handling and circuit breaking
   - Verify the replay functionality for the DLQ

3. **Testing & Benchmarking**
   - Create unit tests for each component
   - Create integration tests for the full pipeline
   - Create benchmark tests to verify performance requirements
   - Verify all functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-8)

4. **Documentation (Completion)**
   - Complete user documentation
   - Improve developer documentation
   - Document APIs and interfaces
   - Create deployment guides

## Current Priorities

1. Implement the mock upstream service
2. Implement the outage simulator
3. Create comprehensive tests for all components
4. Perform end-to-end testing and benchmarking

## Implementation Details

### CardinalityLimiter

The CardinalityLimiter uses an entropy-based algorithm to determine which key-sets to keep, drop, or aggregate when cardinality exceeds the configured limit. Key features:

- Dynamically tracks unique key-sets in a hash table
- Calculates entropy scores based on information content
- Prioritizes key-sets with high entropy (more information)
- Supports drop, aggregate, or hybrid strategies

### AdaptivePriorityQueue

The AdaptivePriorityQueue implements weighted round-robin scheduling with three priority levels. Key features:

- O(1) enqueue/dequeue operations
- WRR scheduling with 5:3:1 ratio (critical:high:normal)
- Circuit breaker pattern for backend issues
- DLQ spill when queue exceeds 95% capacity

### EnhancedDLQ

The EnhancedDLQ exporter provides durable storage with data integrity verification. Key features:

- File-based storage with fsync for durability
- SHA-256 verification for data integrity
- Rate-limited replay at 4 MiB/s
- 1:1 interleaving of replay and live traffic
- Configurable retention policy
