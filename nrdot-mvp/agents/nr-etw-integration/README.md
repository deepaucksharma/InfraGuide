# Windows ETW Integration Stub

This is a placeholder for the Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) integration.
In a production environment, this would be replaced with the actual `nr-etw-integration` 
component running in a Windows container or host.

## Integration Details

When implemented, this component would:

1. Capture Windows Event Tracing data
2. Convert it to OTLP format
3. Send it to the collector endpoint (http://collector:4318)

## Configuration

Sample configuration would include:

```yaml
otlp:
  endpoint: "http://collector:4318"
  flush_interval: 2s

capture:
  event_sources:
    - "Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process"
    - "Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Network"
    - "Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime"

settings:
  buffer_size: 64MiB
  event_limit: 10000
```

## Implementation Status

This component is not included in the Linux-only MVP but would be part of the full implementation.
