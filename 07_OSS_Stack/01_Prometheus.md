# Prometheus Architecture & Integration

## Executive Summary

Prometheus has emerged as the de facto standard for Kubernetes monitoring in open source environments. This chapter provides a deep technical analysis of Prometheus architecture, its strengths and limitations, and integration approaches with New Relic. We examine the fundamental design choices that shape Prometheus's capabilities, its performance characteristics at scale, and how to effectively combine Prometheus with New Relic to leverage the strengths of both platforms.

As organizations adopt Kubernetes, they frequently deploy Prometheus as their initial monitoring solution due to its native integration and community support. However, as environments grow, limitations in Prometheus's architecture for long-term storage, cross-cluster visibility, and high-cardinality workloads become apparent. This chapter guides architects and operators through understanding these limitations and implementing hybrid architectures that maintain the benefits of local Prometheus deployments while addressing enterprise-scale challenges through integration with New Relic's dimensional data model.

## Prometheus Architecture Deep-Dive

Prometheus implements a pull-based monitoring system with a time series database (TSDB) designed for operational monitoring of dynamic container environments.

```

### Core Components

1. **Service Discovery**: Dynamically discovers targets to monitor in Kubernetes and other environments
2. **Scraper**: Pulls metrics from instrumented applications and exporters
3. **TSDB**: Stores time series data in a custom, memory-mapped storage format
4. **Query Engine**: Processes PromQL queries against the TSDB
5. **Rules Evaluator**: Executes alerting and recording rules
6. **HTTP API**: Serves queries, targets, and metadata

### Storage Architecture

Prometheus employs a custom time series database (TSDB) with several unique characteristics:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Prometheus TSDB Architecture"
        M[Metric Samples] --> H[Head Block]
        H --> C[Compactor]
        C --> B1[Block n]
        C --> B2[Block n+1]
        C --> B3[Block n+2]
        
        B1 --> |Retention Exceeded| D[Deletion]
        
        H --> I1[Inverted Index]
        B1 --> I2[Block Index]
        B2 --> I3[Block Index]
        
        I1 & I2 & I3 --> Q[Query]
    end
    
    classDef active fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef storage fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef index fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef query fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class M,H active
    class C,B1,B2,B3,D storage
    class I1,I2,I3 index
    class Q query
```

Key storage characteristics:

- **Block-based storage**: Data stored in 2-hour blocks
- **Write-ahead log**: Recent data kept in memory-mapped WAL
- **Columnar storage**: Series data stored by metric name and labels
- **Local-only design**: Primary storage is local disk
- **Retention by deletion**: Old blocks deleted based on retention policy

### PromQL Language Model

Prometheus's query language (PromQL) is a functional language designed for time series operations:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "PromQL Query Structure"
        I[Instant Vector] -->|Operators| E[Expression]
        R[Range Vector] -->|Functions| E
        E -->|Aggregations| F[Final Result]
    end
    
    subgraph "Query Types"
        F --> V[Vector]
        F --> S[Scalar]
        F --> M[Matrix]
        
        V --> Alerts[Alerting]
        M --> Graph[Graphing]
        S --> Display[Single Value]
    end
    
    classDef input fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef processing fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef output fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef use fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class I,R input
    class E,F processing
    class V,S,M output
    class Alerts,Graph,Display use
```

## Performance Characteristics

Prometheus performance varies significantly based on deployment configuration, cardinality, and query patterns.

### Resource Requirements by Scale

| Deployment Size | Active Series | Scrape Interval | CPU Usage | Memory Usage | Disk Usage | Query Performance |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Small | <100K | 15s | 0.5-1 core | 2-4 GB | 1-2 GB/day | <100ms |
| Medium | 100K-500K | 15-30s | 2-4 cores | 8-16 GB | 4-8 GB/day | 100-500ms |
| Large | 500K-2M | 30s | 4-8 cores | 32-64 GB | 15-30 GB/day | 0.5-2s |
| Very Large | >2M | 60s | 8-16+ cores | 64-128+ GB | 30-60+ GB/day | 2-10s+ |

### Key Performance Factors

1. **Cardinality Growth**: Series count is the primary determinant of resource usage
2. **Retention Setting**: Default 15-day retention; longer periods increase disk usage linearly
3. **Query Complexity**: Aggregate queries over long time ranges can be resource-intensive
4. **Label Cardinality**: High-cardinality labels multiply resource requirements
5. **Scrape Frequency**: More frequent scraping increases CPU and storage requirements

### Performance Bottlenecks

```

## Scaling Prometheus

Several approaches have emerged to scale Prometheus beyond single-instance limitations:

### Horizontal Sharding

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Functional Sharding"
        FS[Shard by Function] --> FS1[Infrastructure Prometheus]
        FS --> FS2[Application Prometheus]
        FS --> FS3[Database Prometheus]
    end
    
    subgraph "Metric Sharding"
        MS[Shard by Metric Type] --> MS1[Counter Metrics]
        MS --> MS2[Gauge Metrics]
        MS --> MS3[Histogram Metrics]
    end
    
    subgraph "Target Sharding"
        TS[Shard by Target] --> TS1[Namespace A Targets]
        TS --> TS2[Namespace B Targets]
        TS --> TS3[Namespace C Targets]
    end
    
    subgraph "Query Federation"
        Q[Query Layer]
        FS1 & FS2 & FS3 --> Q
        MS1 & MS2 & MS3 --> Q
        TS1 & TS2 & TS3 --> Q
    end
    
    classDef shardtype fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef shard fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef query fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class FS,MS,TS shardtype
    class FS1,FS2,FS3,MS1,MS2,MS3,TS1,TS2,TS3 shard
    class Q query
```

### High-Availability Options

| HA Approach | Implementation | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Thanos** | Sidecar-based architecture with object storage | Global query view, unlimited retention | Complex setup, eventual consistency |
| **Cortex** | Microservice architecture with shared storage | Multi-tenancy, horizontal scaling | Operational complexity, stateful components |
| **Prometheus Federation** | Pull metrics from multiple Prometheus servers | Simple setup, hierarchical | Limited scalability, duplicate storage |
| **M3DB** | Distributed TSDB backend | High performance, strong consistency | Requires separate infrastructure |
| **VictoriaMetrics** | Drop-in replacement with clustering | High compression, fast queries | Less community support |

### Thanos Architecture

Thanos extends Prometheus for long-term storage and global querying:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Prometheus Instances"
        P1[Prometheus 1] --> S1[Thanos Sidecar 1]
        P2[Prometheus 2] --> S2[Thanos Sidecar 2]
        P3[Prometheus N] --> S3[Thanos Sidecar N]
    end
    
    subgraph "Thanos Components"
        S1 & S2 & S3 --> Store[Thanos Store Gateway]
        S1 & S2 & S3 --> Query[Thanos Query]
        
        Store --> Query
        Object[Object Storage] <--> Store
        
        S1 & S2 & S3 --> Object
        
        Query --> Compact[Thanos Compactor]
        Compact --> Object
        
        Query --> Ruler[Thanos Ruler]
        Ruler --> Query
        Ruler --> Object
    end
    
    classDef prometheus fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef thanos fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef storage fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class P1,P2,P3 prometheus
    class S1,S2,S3,Store,Query,Compact,Ruler thanos
    class Object storage
```

## New Relic Integration Options

Several approaches exist for integrating Prometheus with New Relic, each with different trade-offs:

### Integration Architecture Comparison

| Integration Method | Implementation | Data Flow | Pros | Cons |
|--------------------|----------------|----------|------|------|
| **Remote Write** | Direct from Prometheus | Prometheus → New Relic | Simple setup, real-time | High cardinality limitations |
| **OpenTelemetry Collector** | Via OTel pipeline | Prometheus → OTel → New Relic | Flexible filtering, enrichment | Additional component |
| **Prometheus Exporter** | New Relic exposes /metrics | New Relic → Prometheus | Local visibility, no egress costs | Duplicate storage |
| **Grafana Integration** | Via Grafana datasources | Parallel paths to each platform | Unified visualization | No data integration |
| **Prometheus NerdGraph API** | Push via PromQL API | Custom code → New Relic | Complete control | Development overhead |

### Remote Write Integration

The most direct integration method is Prometheus Remote Write:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Kubernetes Cluster"
        P[Prometheus] --> RW[Remote Write]
        RW --> F[Optional Filtering]
        F --> C[Compression]
        C --> S[Secure Transport]
    end
    
    subgraph "New Relic Platform"
        S --> E[NRDB Endpoint]
        E --> I[Ingest Processor]
        I --> T[Transformation]
        T --> D[Dimensional Metrics]
    end
    
    classDef prometheus fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef transport fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef newrelic fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class P,RW,F prometheus
    class C,S transport
    class E,I,T,D newrelic
```

#### Remote Write Configuration

```yaml
# Prometheus remote_write configuration
remote_write:
  - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_PROMETHEUS_SERVER_NAME
    bearer_token: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
    
    # Optional: Control which metrics are sent
    write_relabel_configs:
      # Include only metrics with specific names
      - source_labels: [__name__]
        regex: 'node_.*|container_.*|kube_.*'
        action: keep
      
      # Exclude high-cardinality or noisy metrics
      - source_labels: [__name__]
        regex: 'container_memory_working_set_bytes|kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_reason'
        action: drop
        
      # Limit high-cardinality labels
      - regex: 'id|pod_id|container_id'
        action: labeldrop

    queue_config:
      # Tune for better performance
      capacity: 10000
      max_samples_per_send: 5000

      max_shards: 10
      min_backoff: 30ms
      max_backoff: 5s
```

### OpenTelemetry Collector Integration

For more sophisticated processing, the OpenTelemetry Collector provides enhanced capabilities:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Kubernetes Cluster"
        P[Prometheus] --> PR[Prometheus Receiver]
        PR --> B[Batch Processor]
        B --> F[Filter Processor]
        F --> M[Metrics Transform]
        M --> A[Attributes Processor]
        A --> NRE[New Relic Exporter]
    end
    
    subgraph "New Relic Platform"
        NRE --> E[NRDB Endpoint]
        E --> D[Dimensional Metrics]
    end
    
    classDef prometheus fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef otel fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef newrelic fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class P prometheus
    class PR,B,F,M,A,NRE otel
    class E,D newrelic
```

#### OTel Collector Configuration

```yaml

      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'federate'
          scrape_interval: 15s
          honor_labels: true
          metrics_path: '/federate'
          params:
            'match[]':
              - '{job=~".+"}'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['prometheus-server:9090']

  # Filter high-cardinality metrics
  filter:
    metrics:
      exclude:
        match_type: regexp
        metric_names:
          - 'container_memory_working_set_bytes'
          - 'kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_reason'
  
  # Transform metrics to New Relic format
  metricstransform:
    transforms:
      - include: 'kube_pod_status_phase'
        action: update
        new_name: 'k8s.pod.status.phase'
        operations:

        new_key: namespaceName

exporters:
  # New Relic exporter
  newrelic:
    apikey: ${NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY}
    timeout: 30s
    metrics_url_override: "https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1"

      receivers: [prometheus]
      processors: [batch, filter, metricstransform, attributes]
      exporters: [newrelic]
```

## Data Model Translation

A key challenge in Prometheus integration is mapping between Prometheus's simple label-based model and New Relic's dimensional data model.

### Metric Naming Convention Translation

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Prometheus Model"
        PM[Metric Name] --> PE[node_cpu_seconds_total]
        PL[Labels] --> PL1["cpu='0'"]
        PL --> PL2["mode='idle'"]
        PL --> PL3["instance='node-1'"]
    end
    
    subgraph "New Relic Model"
        NM[Metric Name] --> NE["node.cpu.seconds"]
        NA[Attributes] --> NA1["cpu='0'"]
        NA --> NA2["mode='idle'"]
        NA --> NA3["instance='node-1'"]
        NI[Intrinsics] --> NI1["eventType='Metric'"] 
        NI --> NI2["metricName='node.cpu.seconds'"]
    end
    
    PM -.->|Translation| NM
    PL -.->|Translation| NA
    PM -.->|Counter Detection| NI3["metricType='count'"]
    
    classDef prometheus fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef newrelic fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef mapping fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class PM,PE,PL,PL1,PL2,PL3 prometheus
    class NM,NE,NA,NA1,NA2,NA3,NI,NI1,NI2,NI3 newrelic
```

### Metric Type Mapping

| Prometheus Type | New Relic Type | Transformation | Example |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Counter | Count | Rate calculation | `rate(http_requests_total[5m])` → `rate(sum(http.requests), 5 minutes)` |
| Gauge | Gauge | Direct mapping | `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes` → `node.memory.available.bytes` |
| Histogram | Distribution | Bucket conversion | Histogram buckets → percentile calculations |
| Summary | Summary | Quantile mapping | Pre-calculated quantiles → individual metrics |

### Naming Convention Translation

| Prometheus Pattern | New Relic Pattern | Example Transformation |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| `snake_case` | `dot.notation` | `container_cpu_usage_seconds` → `container.cpu.usage.seconds` |
| `_total` suffix | No suffix, count type | `http_requests_total` → `http.requests` (count type) |
| Unit in name | Unit as attribute | `node_memory_bytes` → `node.memory` with `units: bytes` |
| Verb underscore object | Object dot verb | `process_cpu_seconds` → `process.cpu.seconds` |

## Deployment Models

Different integration models are appropriate for different environments and requirements:

### 1. Prometheus First, New Relic Aggregation

In this model, Prometheus is the primary monitoring system, with select metrics forwarded to New Relic:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Kubernetes Clusters"
        subgraph "Cluster 1"
            P1[Prometheus 1] --> RW1[Remote Write]
        end
        
        subgraph "Cluster 2"
            P2[Prometheus 2] --> RW2[Remote Write]
        end
        
        subgraph "Cluster 3"
            P3[Prometheus 3] --> RW3[Remote Write]
        end
    end
    
    RW1 & RW2 & RW3 --> NR[New Relic]
    
    P1 --> G1[Local Grafana]
    P2 --> G2[Local Grafana]
    P3 --> G3[Local Grafana]
    
    NR --> D[Cross-Cluster Dashboards]
    NR --> A[Global Alerting]
    NR --> L[Long-term Storage]
    
    classDef prometheus fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef transport fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef newrelic fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef visualization fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class P1,P2,P3 prometheus
    class RW1,RW2,RW3 transport
    class NR,D,A,L newrelic
    class G1,G2,G3 visualization
```

**Best for:**
- Existing Prometheus investments
- Teams comfortable with PromQL
- Need for local, low-latency monitoring
- Requirement for cross-cluster visibility

### 2. New Relic First, Prometheus Exporters

In this model, New Relic is the primary monitoring system, with Prometheus used for specialized local monitoring:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Kubernetes Cluster"
        NRA[New Relic Agent] --> NR[New Relic]
        
        subgraph "Local Monitoring"
            NRE[NR Prometheus Exporter]
            LP[Local Prometheus]
            NRE --> LP
            LP --> LG[Local Grafana]
        end
        
        NRA --> NRE
    end
    
    NR --> GD[Global Dashboards]
    NR --> GA[Global Alerting]
    
    classDef newrelic fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef prometheus fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef visualization fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class NRA,NR,GD,GA,NRE newrelic
    class LP prometheus
    class LG visualization
```

**Best for:**
- New Relic-first environments
- Need for specialized local monitoring
- Compliance with open standards
- Air-gapped or limited connectivity environments

### 3. Side-by-Side Model

In this model, both systems operate independently with optional cross-system visualization:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Kubernetes Cluster"
        APP[Applications] --> ME[/metrics Endpoint]
        
        ME --> P[Prometheus]
        ME --> NRA[New Relic Agent]
        
        P --> PA[Prometheus Alertmanager]
        P --> PG[Prometheus Grafana]
        
        NRA --> NR[New Relic]
    end
    
    NR --> ND[New Relic Dashboards]
    NR --> NA[New Relic Alerts]
    
    PG <-.->|Optional| NFG[New Relic Grafana Integration]
    ND <-.->|Optional| NFG
    
    classDef app fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef prometheus fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef newrelic fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef integration fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class APP,ME app
    class P,PA,PG prometheus
    class NRA,NR,ND,NA newrelic
    class NFG integration
```

**Best for:**
- Transitional environments
- Teams with mixed preferences
- Comparison and validation needs
- Gradual migration strategies

## Performance Benchmarks

Comparative performance between Prometheus and New Relic across key dimensions:

### Query Performance Comparison

| Query Type | Prometheus | New Relic | Notes |
|------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| **Point-in-time, single metric** | Very Fast (10-50ms) | Fast (50-200ms) | Prometheus excels at simple, real-time queries |
| **Range query, 1 hour** | Fast (50-200ms) | Fast (100-250ms) | Comparable performance |
| **Range query, 1 day** | Medium (200-500ms) | Fast (150-300ms) | New Relic's advantage grows with range |
| **Range query, 1 week** | Slow (500-2000ms) | Medium (300-500ms) | New Relic significantly better for historical data |
| **High-cardinality filter** | Very Slow (1-10s) | Medium (300-800ms) | New Relic handles high cardinality better |
| **Cross-metric correlation** | Slow (1-5s) | Medium (300-600ms) | New Relic's dimensional model advantages |

### Storage Efficiency Comparison

| Metric | Prometheus | New Relic | Notes |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------|
| **Storage per 1M series-day** | 1-2 GB | 0.6-1.2 GB | New Relic more efficient at scale |
| **Compression ratio** | 3-5× | 5-10× | New Relic's columnar storage advantage |
| **Retention capability** | Days to weeks | Months to years | New Relic designed for long-term storage |
| **High-cardinality handling** | Poor (series explosion) | Good (dimensional model) | Critical difference for large deployments |
| **Query performance at scale** | Degrades with size | Consistent | New Relic maintains performance at scale |

## Implementation Best Practices

### Remote Write Optimization

1. **Selective Metric Forwarding**: Only send metrics needed for long-term analysis or cross-cluster visibility
2. **Label Filtering**: Drop high-cardinality labels before forwarding
3. **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate queue sizes and batch settings
4. **Consistent Naming**: Establish clear naming conventions between systems
5. **Health Monitoring**: Monitor the remote_write queue for backpressure

### Capacity Planning

| Component | Sizing Guideline | Example Calculation |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Prometheus Memory** | (Active Series × 2-3 bytes) × 2 overhead | 1M series × 6 bytes = 6GB |
| **Prometheus Storage** | Active Series × Bytes per Sample × Samples per Series | 1M × 1.5 bytes × 5760 samples = 8.6GB/day |
| **Remote Write Bandwidth** | Series × Sample Size × Frequency × Compression | 100K series × 10 bytes × 6/min × 0.1 = 100KB/s |
| **OTel Collector Memory** | 50MB base + (TPS × 100 bytes) | 50MB + (1000 TPS × 100 bytes) = 150MB |
| **OTel Collector CPU** | 0.5 core + (0.1 core per 1000 TPS) | 0.5 + (10000 TPS × 0.1/1000) = 1.5 cores |

### Operational Runbook for Integration

1. **Pre-integration Assessment**
   - Inventory metric cardinality and volume
   - Identify critical vs. optional metrics
   - Establish integration SLOs

2. **Deployment Steps**
   - Test in non-production first
   - Deploy with conservative rate limits
   - Gradually increase forwarding volume
   - Validate data accuracy in both systems

3. **Monitoring the Integration**
   - Track remote_write queue metrics
   - Monitor network bandwidth usage
   - Verify metric arrival in New Relic
   - Compare metric values between systems

4. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
   - Queue backpressure: Adjust batch sizes and timeouts
   - Series mismatch: Check relabeling configurations
   - Data gaps: Check connectivity and authentication
   - Value discrepancies: Verify rate() calculations
