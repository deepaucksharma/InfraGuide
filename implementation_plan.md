## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to completing the New Relic Ingest & Instrumentation Landscape book. By prioritizing core New Relic-specific content first, the plan ensures that the most valuable technical content is delivered early, while building toward a comprehensive ecosystem view. The emphasis on visual elements throughout ensures alignment with the project's goal of creating a highly accessible, diagram-rich resource for the technical audience.

Progress will be tracked weekly against the timeline, with adjustments made based on actual completion rates and emerging priorities.
